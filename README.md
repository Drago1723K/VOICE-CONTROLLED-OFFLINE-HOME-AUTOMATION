# VOICE-CONTROLLED-OFFLINE-HOME-AUTOMATION
Voice-Controlled Offline Home Automation using VOSK API
Abstract :
   This project presents a smart home automation system that can be controlled via voice commands without the need for an internet connection. It leverages the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi along with the VOSK speech recognition toolkit to interpret voice inputs and control household appliances using relays. The system is designed for convenience, especially for the elderly and physically challenged, while maintaining privacy and operational independence from cloud-based services. Its offline functionality ensures uninterrupted control even in the absence of internet access.
